The rise of the data driven enterprise

Enterprise data is a critical component of business operations and decision making. In order to capitalize on the opportunities that big data presents, businesses need to overcome several challenges. These include the management and governance of data, the ability to analyze data in a timely manner, and the ability to access data quickly and easily. A data-driven enterprise is one that collects and analyzes data in order to make better business decisions. It harnesses the power of big data to improve performance and profitability. The key to success for a data-driven enterprise is the ability to manage and govern data effectively, so that it can be accessed and analyzed quickly and easily.

A big data platform is an essential component of a data-driven business. It makes it possible for businesses to store, manage, and analyze large amounts of structured and unstructured data quickly and easily. A well implemented big data platform also enables self service access to data for analysts, so they are able to discover insights that can help improve business performance. Storing large volumes of high-value data requires a reliable architecture, fault tolerance, and full recoverability in order to mitigate business risk. A

The architecture of an enterprise modern data platform is typically a multi-tier design. The tiers typically include a data ingestion layer, a data processing layer, and a data storage layer. The data ingestion layer is responsible for collecting data from various sources and loading it into the platform. The data processing layer is responsible for transforming, cleaning, and preparing the data for analysis. The data storage layer is responsible for storing the data in a reliable and scalable manner. The big data platform must also be integrated with the enterprise environment. It must include authentication, authorization, and encryption.  It must also be secure, flexible, and scalable. The big data platform must provide a unified view of all enterprise applications and data sources. It should also provide access to the latest data from every source in near real time, so that businesses can make fact-based decisions in a timely manner.

In order for a business to fully capitalize on the insights provided by big data, it also needs the right people and processes in place. For example, businesses must be able to analyze tremendous amounts of data quickly so that they can act on new information before it loses value. They must also monitor the effectiveness of their business decisions based on changes in performance metrics. Businesses must also ensure that their data is governed and protected. They must comply with industry regulations regarding the use of data, such as HIPAA and Basel II. They need to improve their data quality, and they must also keep up with changes in technology. In addition to having the right people in place, businesses must establish a culture of self-service decision making in which employees are empowered to make decisions based on business analytics. 

The last challenge for the modern data-driven enterprise is time to value. A data-driven organization must be able to put insights from big data into action quickly, so that it can capitalize on new opportunities and avoid competitive disadvantage. Time to value has proven to be an issue with Hadoop as the data landcape has changed, however. 

The rise and fall of Hadoop

Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat co-authored the whitepapers around a distributed file system, called GFS (Google File System) in 2003 and a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets called MapReduce in 2004.
